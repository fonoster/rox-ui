# Roxanne Assistant

Roxanne is a voice assistant fully capable of interpreting human requests and processing them as intentions.

Roxanne will take her audios through her microphone and send them to the [Fonoster APIs](https://fonoster.com/) to get a pre-programmed intent.

### How to use

You just need to add the script on your website or app with the `key` provided by Fonoster.

> It is important not to remove the `id` from the script as it is used as an identity in the DOM.

```html
  <!-- Fonoster assistant begin -->
  <script
    id="rox-script"
    type="text/javascript"
    src="https://efraa.github.io/assistant/web.js?key=1413d7-031-13bWa28"
  >
  </script>
  <!-- Fonoster assistant end -->
```
